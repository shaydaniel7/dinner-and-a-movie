# Dinner and a Movie
This webpage provides some guidance on the simple yet difficult
task of picking where to eat and what movie to watch. There are 
two sets of input fields for the user to fill out in order to
retrieve results.

### Getting Results
Upon loading the webpage, you will find it is divided into two sections.
On the left you will find two input boxes: one to enter the city you reside
in or are visiting, and the second to enter any type of cuisine you crave.
_(example: mexican, burger, ice cream)_
On the right you will find one selection box. Click it to reveal the different
genre options for a movie to watch.

#### Restaurant Results
After the two boxes are filled, you may hit the search button to display the 
top 10 results that match your criteria.

#### Movie Results
Once you have selected a genre of interest, hit the search button under the
selection box to display a list of 10 movies of that genre. The movies
are sorted by current popularity.
